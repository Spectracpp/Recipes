    <h1>Rajma Masala</h1>
    <img src="rajma-recipe-1.jpg" height="300">
    <p>This Rajma recipe is a lightly spiced, creamy and delicious Punjabi style curry made with protein rich kidn  ey   beans, aromatics like onions, ginger, garlic, fragrant spices and tangy tomatoes. My Mom’s recipe for restaurant-style Punjabi Rajma Masala is a staple in our home, and after you try it I’ll bet it becomes one at yours, too. I also share a homestyle one pot Rajma Masala (which many of our readers had requested) that will remind you about the comforting and satisfying Rajma Curry (or Rajma Chawal) made in Punjabi homes</p>
